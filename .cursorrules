Project intelligence notes:
- Follow assignment phases strictly; each phase clearly labeled in notebook.
- Avoid pandas per requirements; rely on NumPy and sklearn.
- Target variable is MedHouseVal (x100k USD).
- Prefer pipelines for CV; scale inputs for SGD.
- Document metrics consistently (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2) and compare.
- Report should summarize EDA insights, strongest correlations, model comparisons, and CV stability.
