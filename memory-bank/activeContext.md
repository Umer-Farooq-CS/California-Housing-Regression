# Active Context

Current focus: Phases 1–5 are complete in `notebooks/Assignment1.ipynb` with figures exported to `data/` and results summarized.
Next: Maintain repo hygiene only (minor tweaks if needed). Report PDF compiled at `reports/Report.pdf`; LaTeX source under `reports/lncs/`.
Decisions: NumPy-only stats (no pandas), StandardScaler for SGD, polynomial features (deg 2–3) for comparisons, pipelines for CV.


All visualizations finalized. README updated with results summary and reproduction steps.
