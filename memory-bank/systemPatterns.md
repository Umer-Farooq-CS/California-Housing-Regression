# System Patterns

- Notebook-driven workflow with clear phase headings.
- NumPy-first (no pandas) for statistics and data handling.
- Use of StandardScaler for SGD stability.
- PolynomialFeatures for engineered terms (deg 2, 3) when comparing models.
- Cross-validation via KFold and pipelines for scaling + estimator.
- Memory Bank used to track progress and decisions.
